                <p>Your BMI is a measurement that is a ratio of your weight and height. It’s a good way to gauge whether
                    your weight is in healthy proportion to your height. In fact, knowing your BMI can help you – and
                    your GP – determine any health risks you may face if it’s outside of the healthy range.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While it may be a great guide to establishing the amount of body fat you carry, your BMI won’t take
                    into consideration your age, sex, ethnicity, or even muscle mass. It’s also not appropriate in
                    determining a healthy weight in the elderly, children, pregnant women or even athletes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'll be the first to admit that it's pretty awesome to slip on a skimpy swimsuit and know you look
                    amazing in it. But maintaining a healthy weight (whether that means dropping a few pounds or gaining
                    some) is about so much more than inciting envy when you're at the pool. Here's proof

        <h2 class="section-head">Under Weight</h2>
        <p>If you’re underweight, you may not be eating enough healthy
            foods with key nutrients to fuel your body. That can cause
            malnutrition. Over time, malnutrition can affect your healt
            h in a number of different ways that may be noticeable to you
            or those around you.</p>
        <h3>Consequnces of being Under weight</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Decreased Immunity</h4>
                <p>A recent reviewTrusted Source of studies found a connection between increased infections and being
                    underweight. The researchers noted their difficulty in determining if this is a result of being
                    underweight or if it has more to do the underlying causes for being underweight. For example,
                    malnourishment may lead to decreased immune function and also cause people to be underweight. More
                    research is needed to fully understand the connection between weight and immune function.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Increased risk of surgical complications</h4>
                <p>One study found evidence that underweight people who had total knee replacement surgery were more
                    likely to develop infections following the surgery than people who were not underweight. While they
                    could not determine the reasons for this, they believe underweight people aren’t able to heal wounds
                    as well as people with a normal BMI. They also found that the underweight group had low preoperative
                    hemoglobin. While more research is needed, the findings suggest that being underweight can affect
                    your ability to heal wounds.</p>
                <p>Another study found increased complications in underweight people who had total hip replacement
                    surgery compared with people of normal weight. Complications following coronary bypass surgery and
                    lung transplants also seem to be higher for people who are underweight. Researchers have also linked
                    low BMI to increased incidences of postoperative deaths within the first year following a lower
                    extremity bypass surgery.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Osteoporosis</h4>
                <p>Low body weight may increase your risk for low bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis. One
                    studyTrusted Source looked at BMD in 1,767 premenopausal women, and found that 24 percent of women
                    with a BMI of 18.5 or lower had a low BMD. Only 9.4 percent of participants with a BMI higher than
                    18.5 had low BMD. The study results suggest that being underweight increases risk for osteoporosis..

        <p>Reaching and maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can help you prevent and
            control many diseases and conditions. If you are overweight or obese, you are at higher risk of developing
            serious health problems, including heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, gallstones,
            breathing problems, and certain cancers. That is why maintaining a healthy weight is so important: It helps
            you lower your risk for developing these problems, helps you feel good about yourself, and gives you more
            energy to enjoy life</p>
        <p>By maintaining a healthy weight and normal BMI you’re likely to have fewer joint and muscle pains, more
            energy, better regulation of bodily fluids and blood pressure, reduced burden to your heart and circulatory
            system, better sleep, reductions in blood triglycerides, blood sugar, and the risk of developing diabetes,
            and reduced risk for heart disease and certain cancers.
        </p>
        <p>According to a 2012 study from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, losing weight—especially pesky
            abdominal fat—can help you log higher-quality Zzs. "Fat, and particularly belly fat, interferes with lung
            function," says Kerry J. Stewart, Ed.D., a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University and one of the
            study authors. "It becomes harder for the lungs to expand because fat is in the way." And since breathing
            issues can lead to nighttime problems like sleep apnea, it takes a toll on your shuteye
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s no secret that normal weight people have a lower risk of disease and thus, live longer. But do you know
            just how much longer? The Organisation for Economic Co‑operation and Development, which has studied the
            global economic impacts of obesity, says that for every 33 pounds of excess weight, the risk of death
            increases by about 30 percent. They estimate that the lifespan of an obese person (that's anyone with a BMI
            of 40-45) is up to 10 years shorter than that of a normal-weight person.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-head">Over Weight</h2>
        <p>Being overweight or obese puts you at a greater risk of developing diabetes mellitus, heart disease,
            osteoarthritis of the hips, knees and ankles (due to increased wear and tear on those joints) and a host of
            other medical problems. Don’t forget your HealthTeam Advantage plan includes complimentary membership to
            SilverSneakers
        </p>
        <p>You’re at a higher risk of health issues if your BMI is 35-39.9 and you have two or more weight-related
            medical problems—in fact, you’re considered morbidly obese (deathly fat). Your risk of medical
            complications, (heart attack or stroke that could result in death), is significantly elevated. The same
            morbidly obese category applies if your BMI is more than 39.9 even if you’re otherwise healthy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Excess weight increases the work your heart must do. It also raises blood pressure and blood cholesterol and
            triglyceride levels and lowers HDL (good) cholesterol levels. It can make diabetes more likely to develop,
            too. Lifestyle changes that help you maintain a 3-5% weight loss are likely to result in clinically
            meaningful improvements in blood glucose, triglycerides, and risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater
            weight loss can even help reduce BP and improve blood cholesterol.
        </p>
        <p>Being overweight or obese are both terms for having more body fat than what is considered healthy. Both are
            used to identify people who are at risk for health problems from having too much body fat. However, the term
            "obese" generally means a much higher amount of body fat than "overweight."
        </p>

        <p> Everyone needs some body fat for energy, heat insulation, and other body functions. But having too much can
            lead to serious health problems. The more body fat you have, the greater your risk for diabetes, kidney
            disease, heart disease, and other problems.
